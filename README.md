#Assignment on Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a feature/concept in Object Oriented Programming which describes the various forms that a particular object can have. For example, an object can have more than one methods that can be used to achieve a particular result or using one method to achieve different results. There are two types of Polymorphism and they include:

1. Dynamic Polymorphism: This allows methods to be accessed using different approaches, but the end result is always thesame.
2. Static Polymorphism: By applying different parameters to thesame method of an object, we can achieve different results or outputs

#Assignment on Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort

Given an array of numbers, [2,5,3,4,1,6], use bubble sort to re arrange the numbers in the array from smallest to largest 

First Swap
[2|5]  ===> [2,5,3,4,1,6]

Second Swap
[5|3]  ===> [2,3,5,4,1,6]

Third Swap
[5|4]  ===> [2,3,4,5,1,6]

Fourth Swap
[5|1]  ===> [2,3,4,1,5,6]

Fifth Swap
[5|6]  ===> [2,3,4,1,5,6]

Sixth Swap
[2|3]  ===> [2,3,4,1,5,6]

Seventh Swap
[3|4]  ===> [2,3,4,1,5,6]

Eight Swap
