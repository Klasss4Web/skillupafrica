#Assignment on Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a feature/concept in Object Oriented Programming which describes the various forms that a particular object can have. For example, an object can have more than one methods that can be used to achieve a particular result or using one method to achieve different results. There are two types of Polymorphism and they include:

1. Dynamic Polymorphism: This allows methods to be accessed using different approaches, but the end result is always thesame.
2. Static Polymorphism: By applying different parameters to thesame method of an object, we can achieve different results or outputs
